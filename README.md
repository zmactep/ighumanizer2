Immunoglobulin Analys and Humanization Tools
============================================

Overview
--------

This is not an old ighumanizer. This tool was rewrited, so there are not any humanization tools here, 'cause they integrate hard with new version. They will be 
added soon.

Installation
------------

1.  Download NCBI IgBLAST from IgBLAST ftp: ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/blast/executables/igblast/release/
2.  Put it to 'ncbi-blast' directory.
3.  Download additional NCBI databases and put it to 'database' directory.
4*. Run etc/dbalias_creation.sh, if you want to export human proteins from 'nr' database to new 'nr_human' database. You need BLAST+ to be installed.
